FineDine
It is my protfolio project that I worked on while I was at NuCamp Bootcamp.

“Fine Dine’ is a website that will allow people to have Chef cooked meals delivered to their home. The website will let users choose between varieties of meals, number of meals per week, and their food delivery date. Cooking meals several times a day and cleaning the dishes everyday can be overwhelming. Eating out often can be really expensive. With Fine Dine, people can get chef cooked affordable meals every week, plus, they won’t have to worry about having to do dishes.
